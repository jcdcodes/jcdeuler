# anothereuler

Josh works on the Project Euler problems again in order to avoid watching so much television.

## Usage

1. Check in on the Red Sox periodically this summer.
2. Instead of getting emotionally invested in how they're doing and staying up late to watch, do a couple of Project Euler problems.
3. Go to bed.
4. Profit.
